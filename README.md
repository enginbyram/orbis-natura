# orbis-natura
This is my blog/idea-dump/fantasy world wiki/short story dumping zone. I like to call it wikiblog or _shitzone_. [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) is the backbone of this structure. No premade theme used, all crated by my dirty hands.

## Plugins that I have externally added
If you go into the `Gemfile`, you can have a better look. What I remember is:

- [jekyll-toc](https://github.com/toshimaru/jekyll-toc) (!this does not work! using custom made)
- [jekyll-date-localization](https://github.com/krupkat/jekyll-date-localization) (!it does work sometimes, but not always, why? !)
- github-pages (you need it for GithubPages, monolith)
