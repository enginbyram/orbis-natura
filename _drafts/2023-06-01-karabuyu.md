**Karabüyü**, [Gölgekumaşı’nın](#Gölgekumaşı) uğursuz güçlerini ve nekrotik enerjilerin (canlıların yaşam enerjisinin) manipülasyonu ile kullanılan yasaklanmış kadim bir ekoldür. Karabüyücüler olarak bilinen bu kullanıcılar, ölümün gücünü kullanarak korkunç senaryolara adım atarlar.

1. **Shadow Weave Manipulation:** Shadowmancers have the ability to tap into the ethereal realm of the Shadow Weave, a dark, mystical energy woven within the fabric of reality. They can shape and control these shadowy tendrils, using them to their advantage. Shadowmancers can cloak themselves in darkness, creating illusions and stealthy paths, or unleash concentrated bolts of shadow energy to strike their foes.

2. **Necrotic Channeling:** As masters of death's essence, Shadowmancers possess a unique understanding of necromancy. They can tap into the residual life force of deceased beings, drawing upon necrotic energies to empower themselves or inflict harm upon others. They can manipulate necrotic energy to drain life force from living creatures, causing decay, weakness, and eventually death. Additionally, they can reanimate skeletal minions, bending them to their will and using them as loyal servants.

3. **Eclipse Rituals:** Shadowmancers are known for their complex and elaborate rituals, performed during the eclipse of celestial bodies. These rituals allow them to access the full potential of their dark magic, amplifying their abilities and tapping into forbidden knowledge. During these rituals, Shadowmancers can summon shadows of the fallen, invoke curses, and gain temporary control over immensely powerful undead creatures.

4. **Soul Tethering:** A distinct aspect of Shadowmancy is the ability to forge connections with souls and wield them as a source of power. Shadowmancers can bind souls to objects, creating enchanted artifacts that grant them enhanced abilities or act as conduits for dark magic. They can also temporarily tether their own soul to a willing or unwilling participant, gaining complete control over their actions for a limited time.

5. **Shadow Veil:** Shadowmancers have the unique ability to create a Shadow Veil, a dimensional barrier that merges the material realm with the shadow realm. Within this Veil, they gain heightened control over shadows, granting them near-invisibility and the ability to traverse great distances instantaneously. However, the Shadow Veil is dangerous and unpredictable, attracting malevolent spirits and risking corruption of the caster's own soul.

6. **Sacrificial Empowerment:** To attain greater power, Shadowmancers occasionally resort to dark sacrifices. By offering the life force of living beings or powerful magical creatures, they can temporarily boost their abilities to unprecedented levels. However, such acts come with dire consequences, as the Shadowmancer must bear the burden of the sacrificed souls, carrying their presence within them and potentially facing psychological and spiritual degradation.

It's important to remember that practicing Shadowmancy is considered highly taboo and forbidden in most societies due to its association with death and darkness. Those who embrace this magic walk a treacherous path, risking corruption and the potential loss of their humanity. The pursuit of power through Shadowmancy is a dangerous gamble, as the line between control and being consumed by darkness becomes increasingly blurred.
